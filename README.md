# Agent-based_infection_model

## Model scenarios:

1. ABM_code_incrementing_vaccinations_to_current_(last 12 years).ipynb <br>
Model of the last 12 years in which vaccination coverage was increased in to current levels.

2. ABM_code_no_vaccinations_(last 12 years).ipynb <br>
Model scenario for the last 12 years if vaccination was not implemented (counterfactual).

3. ABM_code_incrementing_vaccinations_to_90%_coverage_(next 12 years).ipynb <br>
Model scenario for the next 12 years in which vaccination coverage is uniformly increased.


## S.Pneumoniae and Hib data used to tune the models:

antibiotics_childhood_vaccination.csv (vaccine efficacy against antibiotic use for S. pneumoniae, Hib)<br>
district_populations_extrapolated.csv (extrapolated population per district, based on NFHS4 and NFHS5 population data)<br>
estimated_current_prevalence.pkl (represents current S. pneumoniae prevalence, derived from model scenario 1)<br>
s.pneumoniae_incidence_estimates.csv (2010 incidence of pneumoniae by state)<br>
vaccination_data_condensed.csv (vaccination coverage by state and wealth quintile)<br>
wealthq_data_condensed.csv (proportion of state inhabitants per wealth quintile)<br>

DELETE: 
Adjust population growth rate.ipynb
Data we need for model.md
India_heat_map_code.ipynb (this is general code for making a heatmap)

Should probably delete below as well (I think that the more we supply, the more there is to critique, there's no need to include this)
