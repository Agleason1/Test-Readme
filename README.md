# Agent-based_infection_model

## Model scenarios:

1. ABM_code_incrementing_vaccinations_to_current_(last 12 years).ipynb <br>
Model of the last 12 years in which vaccination coverage was increased in to current levels.

2. ABM_code_no_vaccinations_(last 12 years).ipynb <br>
Model scenario for the last 12 years if vaccination was not implemented (counterfactual).

3. ABM_code_incrementing_vaccinations_to_90%_coverage_(next 12 years).ipynb <br>
Model scenario for the next 12 years in which vaccination coverage is uniformly increased.


## S.Pneumoniae and Hib data used to tune the models:

1. antibiotics_childhood_vaccination.csv <br>
Vaccine efficacy against antibiotic use for S. pneumoniae, Hib
2. district_populations_extrapolated.csv <br>
Extrapolated population per district, based on NFHS4 and NFHS5 population data)
3. estimated_current_prevalence.pkl<br>
Represents current S. pneumoniae prevalence, derived from model scenario 1
4. S. pneumoniae_incidence_estimates.csv<br>
2010 incidence of pneumoniae by state
5. vaccination_data_condensed.csv<br>
vaccination coverage by state and wealth quintile
6. wealthq_data_condensed.csv<br>
Proportion of state inhabitants per wealth quintile

Adjust population growth rate.ipynb
Data we need for model.md
India_heat_map_code.ipynb (this is general code for making a heatmap)

Should probably delete below as well (I think that the more we supply, the more there is to critique, there's no need to include this)
